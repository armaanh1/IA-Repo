Current Mental State (At time of update)
> I haven't changed any code, but I ran it 50 miles away from where I usually work on my code. Java most likley uses location when deciding whether or not to compile my code.
```
try{
    compile();
}
catch (runtime error){

    compile();
    // get wrecked java
}
```
